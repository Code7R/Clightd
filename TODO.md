## 4.1

#### Sensor

- [x] Properly fix support for ALS sensors (right now only acpi-als is supported)
- [ ] Port Sensor interface to map instead of array

## 4.X
- [ ] Keep it up to date with possible ddcutil/libmodule api changes

#### Gamma
- [ ] Add gamma support on wayland (??)
https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/blob/master/examples/gamma-control.c

#### Dpms
- [ ] Add support for dpms on wayland(??)

## Ideas
- [ ] follow ddcci kernel driver and in case, drop ddcutil and add the kernel driver as clightd opt-dep
